# Analyzing Startup Fundraising Deals from Crunchbase

we'll practice using some of the techniques we learned to analyze startup investments from Crunchbase.com.

Every year, thousands of startup companies raise financing from investors. Each time a startup raises money, we refer to the event as a fundraising round. Crunchbase is a website that crowdsources information on the fundraising rounds of many startups. The Crunchbase user community submits, edits, and maintains most of the information in Crunchbase.

In return, Crunchbase makes the data available through a Web application and a fee-based API. Before Crunchbase switched to the paid API model, multiple groups crawled the site and released the data online. Because the information on the startups and their fundraising rounds is always changing, the data set we'll be using isn't completely up to date.
